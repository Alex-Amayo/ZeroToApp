Zero To App is an easily customizable React Native boilerplate that works seamlessly on both web and mobile. The design is loosely based on Facebook's mobile app and website. 
It includes pre-built template pages for your authentication flow, bottom navigation, and basic components that all share common styles you can easily configure from a single file.
