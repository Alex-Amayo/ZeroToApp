Zero To App is an easily customizable React Native boilerplate that works seamlessly on both web and mobile. The design is loosely based on Facebook's mobile app and website. 
It includes pre-built template pages for your authentication flow, bottom navigation, and basic components that all share common styles you can easily configure from a single file. 

# Brand Configuration

The `brandConfig.ts` file defines the styling for the application. It uses a `Brand` object to set various style properties:

- **name**: The name of the brand.
- **colors**: Defines the primary, secondary, background, text, and alternate text colors for the brand.
- **fontSizes**: Sets the font sizes for small, medium, large, and extra-large text.
- **card**: Defines the style for cards, including border radius, shadow opacity, elevation, whether to display a shadow, and the card background color.
